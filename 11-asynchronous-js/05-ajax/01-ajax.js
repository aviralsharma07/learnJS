//* AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
//* XML is a markup language like HTML
//* AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page asynchronously.
//* We have to learn to do HTTP Requests in JavaScript
//* Browser is Client and there is a Server in the backend.
//* We have to make requests to server for various actions like getting data, posting data, updating data, deleting data etc.
//* HTTP is the protocol that is used to send data to and from the server.
//* We use Javascript in client side to make HTTP requests to the server.
//* Whereas Backend can be written in any language like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C# etc.

//* AJAX: is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications.
//* With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
//* without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.
//* We dont use data in the XML format anymore. We use JSON format.
//* JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
//* JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
//* We have 3 most common ways to make HTTP or API requests in JavaScript:
//*    (1) XMLHttpRequest (XHR) -> OLD WAY OF DOING IT
//*    (2) Fetch API -> NEW WAY OF DOING IT
//*    (3) Axios -> THIS IS A THIRD PARTY LIBRARY THAT IS BUILT ON TOP OF FETCH API
